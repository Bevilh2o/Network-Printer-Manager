# Network-Printer-Manager

Network Printer Manager is a simple PowerShell script designed to automate the installation of network printers from a predefined list.

The script was created to simplify deployment across multiple workstations, reducing manual configuration time and minimizing setup errors.

It provides a basic interactive interface where the user selects the printer to install, and the script handles port creation and printer configuration automatically.
